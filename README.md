The Theme Park Management System is a simple PHP/MYSQL project that helps, manages and generates the visitors’ tickets in a theme park.  The system can generate a various ticket at once in different types and all of the tickets have a unique ticket number.  The theme park management can set up different pricing for the rides and entrance that the park offers to the visitors.  The system separates the adult and child fee for every pricing setup.  The manager will act as the administrator to control visitors and tickets. 
The administrator user has the permission to manage all the data in the system especially the rides list and pricing list of the theme park.  This ticketing system also a simple calculator that helps the staff or admin calculates the total amount to pay and change of the customer or visitor.  The ticketing format is just simple, it only displays the ticket number, pax type (Adult/Child), ticket type (e.g. “Entrance”), and the date sold.
